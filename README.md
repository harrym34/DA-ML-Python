# DA-ML-Python
A project aiming towards implementing various data analysis and machine learning techniques in Python, with an emphasis on mathematical formulation rather than just blindly implementing libraries.

## Techniques to include:
- Kernel Methods (PCA, SVM)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (possible quadratic in future)
- Spectral Graph Clustering
- Descent Methods
- Least Squares (Ordinary, Nonlinear, Constrained)
- +more
